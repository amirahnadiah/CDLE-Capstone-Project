# CDLE-Capstone-Project

A simple deep learning for facemask detection
Name of project: FaceMask Detection

# Description of the project:
i.  Add a diagram:

ii.  Input and output information:
  Input: Image of people and real-time monitoring with webcam.
  Output: Classification of people with mask or without mask, and the  
                accuracy of detection.
# Motivation of the idea: 

To provide a fast and convenient way for security to monitor people wearing a mask or not during Pandemic Covid-19.

# Data Set Sources: 
Kaggle Face Mask Detection

# Network Description: 
Tiny-YOLO is a variation of the “You Only Look Once” (YOLO) object detector proposed by Redmon et al. in their 2016 paper. 
Pre-trained model: Tiny-YOLO has 9 convolutional layers and 6 maximum pooling layers.

# Model Training:
1.  Split dataset into 70:30 ratio (70% training set and 30% test set)
2.  Train for 300 epochs	Duration: ~2 hours
3. 	Total Train Image: 60 images with 2 classes

# Testing:
1.  Remaining 30% from dataset split
2.	Total Test Image: 18 images with 2 classes

# Future Development:
1. Add more dataset
2. Add another class such as improper mask
3. Developed with Android application
